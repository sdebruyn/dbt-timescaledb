# Usage

This adapter adds 3 materializations next to the ones available in `dbt-postgres`:

* [Hypertables](hypertables.md)
* [Virtual hypertables](virtual-hypertables.md)
* [Continuous aggregates](continuous-aggregates.md)

Other TimescaleDB features are available natively in dbt as well:

* [Compression](compression.md)
* [Transaction per chunk indexes](indexes.md)
* [Reorder policies](reorder-policies.md)
* [Retention policies](retention-policies.md)

Most of the features are also available as [macros](macros.md).
