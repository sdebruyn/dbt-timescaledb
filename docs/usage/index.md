# Usage

This adapter adds 2 materializations next to the ones available in `dbt-postgres`:

* [Hypertables](hypertables.md)
* [Continuous aggregates](continuous-aggregates.md)

Other TimescaleDB features are available natively in dbt as well:

* [Compression](compression.md)
* [Transaction per chunk indexes](indexes.md)

The amount of features is still quite low as this adapter is still in the alpha stage. More will be added soon.
